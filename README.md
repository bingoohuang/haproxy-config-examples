haproxy configuration examples

## HAProxy Hardware recommandation

Due to its way of working, HAProxy requires:

* CPU: prefer the speed and the cache size over the number of cores
* enough memory to handle all the TCP connections + HAProxy + system * network interfaces: intel ones are usually a good choice
* disk: not required, unless logging locally

In order to get the best performance, a bit of organization is required:

* Network interrupts and kernel on core 0
* HAProxy on next core on the same physical CPU

* NOTE: of course, uninstall irqbalance
* Avoid VM or public cloud with shared resources if the expected workload is important.

## Sysctls tuning

The most important sysctls are:

* net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = "1025 65534" * net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog = 100000
* net.core.netdev_max_backlog = 100000
* net.core.somaxconn = 65534
* ipv4.tcp_rmem = "4096 16060 64060"
* ipv4.tcp_wmem = "4096 16384 262144"

Depending on the workload:

* tcp_slow_start_after_idle = 0

iptables tuning:

* net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_max = 131072
* when improperly configured, conntrack will prevent HAProxy from reaching high performance.
* NOTE: just enabling iptables with connection tracking takes 20% of CPU, even with no rules.

## HAProxy multi-process

Advantages:

* ability to dedicate a process to a task (or application, or protocol)
    In example: 1 process for HTTP and 1 process for MySQL
* scale up: same hardware, more processing capacity by binding processes to different CPU cores
* useful when massive SSL offloading processing is required
    key generation scales almost linearly with number of processes, but TLS session resumption gets little gain over 3 processes

Limitations:

Each process has its own memory area, which means:

* debug mode cancels multi-process (a single process is started)
* frontend(s) and associated backend(s) must run on the same process
* not compatible with peers section (stick table synchronization)
* information is stored locally in each process memory area and can't be shared:
  * stick table + tracked counters
  * statistics
  * server's maxconn (queue management)
  * connection rate
* Each HAProxy process performs its health check:
  * a service is probed by each process
  * a service can temporarly have different status in each process
* managing a configuration which starts up multiple processes can be more complicated

## mysql configuration

[mysql-check doc](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.7/configuration.html#4-option%20mysql-check)

```sql
-- mysql -u root -p
USE mysql;
CREATE USER 'haproxy'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

## Why Alpine

[The Dockerized version of Alpine 3.6 weighs in at 3.98MB.](https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/the-3-biggest-wins-when-using-alpine-as-a-base-docker-image)

For comparison, here’s how Alpine compares to other popular distributions of Linux:

| DISTRIBUTION | VERSION | SIZE    |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| Debian       | Jessie  | 123MB   |
| CentOS       | 7       | 193MB   |
| Fedora       | 25      | 231MB   |
| Ubuntu       | 16\.04  | 118MB   |
| Alpine       | 3\.6    | 3\.98MB |

The markdown table is generated by [tableconvert](https://tableconvert.com/).

Wow, check out the difference in size. Alpine is about 30x smaller than Debian.
